# Route-Lookup
Route Lookup with Binary Search.

    First of all, the program generates the memory of the tables and initialize
    the output variables (). If there is no erros, the tables are filled with the 
    input arguments. Then the program will use a binary search to find the output
    interface for the incommings arguments IPs. Finally, it writes the desired 
    parameters of each test in it's output file. It will also print on screen this
    file.

    To start the program, please use ./my_route_lookup FIB InputPacketFile

    You can take the example files from /Linear Search/

    This project has been develop by Lucia Moreno and Alejandro Calvillo.
